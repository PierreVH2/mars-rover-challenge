# mars-rover-challenge

This is my submission toward my job application at Red Badger.

## Installing

Please ensure you have a recent version of Node and NPM on your machine - [Installing Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

Install all dependencies by executing

```bash
npm install
```

## Running

```bash
npm run start -- <filename>

```

where `<filename>` is the relative or absolute path to a file containing correctly formatted instructions for the challenge.

## Running Unit Tests

```bash
npm run test
```

## Discussion

### Language

I considered several languages, primarily those with which I have recent experience (eg. Javascript, Typescript, C#, Python). I considered Python seriously for the ease with which formatted input and output can be managed, which could cut down development time. That said, I do not have as much recent experience with Python, which may again increase dev time. Javascript is perhaps not he best option for a challenge such as this, since potential employers would look at things like SOLID design principles, which is less easy to demonstrate in a self-evident maneer than strongly types languages such as C# or Typescript due to Javascript's duck-typing ideology.

There was no clear winner along these lines of reasoning, so I decided to tackle the challenge in the language with which I am currently most familiar - Typescript.
